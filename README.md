Right now this is in its infancy, but I've wanted to codify how I determine if a record is genuine evidence
that that person existed for a long time. To automatically reconcile records, not just provide hints, is what
I'm after here. I seek to answer the question: Given this record, and this person, does this record match (or
could it possibly match) this person?
